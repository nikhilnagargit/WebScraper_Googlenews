HDFC Bank’s subsidiary HDB Financial services also could pose challenges during this time, given the focus on weaker informal income segments,” Bernstein said.But Puri downplayed risks to loan quality due to the outbreak of Covid-19, and said the bank’s SME book was backed with additional collateral while the unsecured book was mostly to the salaried class working with companies rated A and above.“When the book is investment grade, there is cushion,” said Puri. “Most of these companies would have the wherewithal to take six months-to-one-year issues, whereby we would be willing, given the fact they have fundamentally sound financials, to sort their cash flow.’’ the HDFC Bank MD added.Puri also said a large part of bank’s book is to quality customers and the bank had tightened underwriting standards even before the coronavirus outbreak. He added that credit card spends will come down in the near term because of restrictions.“In the last one month, we have gone through our entire portfolio with tooth comb. Both corporate and retail to see what is the impact. We have done all the sensitivity analysis and it is not looking worrisome for us. Will there be some (impact)? Absolutely, but we also have large amount of deposits invested in government securities, which will give us further cushion,” he said.Also, 75% of personal loans are to salaried customers of best corporates and are granular in nature. Most of the bank’s SME portfolio comprises borrowers, which have a self-funding component of 60-65%.
